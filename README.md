# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Wine Quality Prediction project ML

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset used contains features such as acidity, alcohol content, sugar levels, and other chemical compounds that influence the wineâ€™s quality. Initially, the data is loaded, cleaned, and examined for any missing values. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable, which is the wine quality. Correlation analysis is performed to identify significant features that impact the quality. A Random Forest Classifier is chosen as the predictive model due to its robustness and interpretability. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the training data. Finally, the model is evaluated for accuracy on unseen data.

## Final Conclusion:
The Wine Quality Prediction project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can be used to predict wine quality from its chemical properties. By using a Random Forest Classifier, the model was able to capture complex relationships between features and wine quality. The data preprocessing, including feature selection and conversion of quality ratings into binary labels, allowed for effective classification. The exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis revealed the key features impacting the wine's quality, such as alcohol content and volatile acidity. After training the model on 80% of the data and testing it on the remaining 20%, the model achieved satisfactory accuracy, confirming its potential for real-world wine quality prediction. This approach can be expanded by using additional datasets or experimenting with other classification algorithms to improve prediction accuracy. The project highlights the power of machine learning in data-driven decision-making in industries such as winemaking. It also underscores the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in building effective models. The findings can be used by winemakers and researchers to gain insights into the factors influencing wine quality. Future work could explore hyperparameter tuning to further optimize model performance.
